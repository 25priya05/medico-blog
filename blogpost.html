        <p class="font1">A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function
            of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury.[1][2] Diseases are
            often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms. A disease may be
            caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. .</p>
        <p class="font1">When we look at the life of doctors, there are many challenges. In an industry, which is
            largely un-organised there is a very urgent need to infuse some structure into it. Something which is
            robust, customer-friendly, and cost-effective. Clinic Management Software, like Docterz, is a solution, that
            can not only handle these challenges but handle them smartly, making life better for everyone involved.

            As an integral component of healthcare quality, patient experience includes several aspects of healthcare
            delivery that patients value highly when they seek and receive care, such as getting timely appointments,
            easy access to information, and good communication with health care providers.
            Well, the eight or more hours of work are all about back-to-back meetings. A doctor’s bread and butter is
            seeing patients, and each appointment is essentially a meeting with a client. You check the details of the
            case, try and get a sense of what’s going on, and then figure out the medicines–often trying to do this
            within a half hour.

            The thinking process is a lot like troubleshooting a broken device, only it’s from a foreign manufacturer.
            You possess thousands of different but crude tools, and you can only try to fix the device so many times.
            When someone comes in with a complaint, you think of a bunch of things it could be (your differential
            diagnosis) and then ask questions to try and narrow it down and separate it from similar problems. Then you
            choose your tests and hope that you can pin down the source of the problem to something in particular (your
            diagnosis). Then you figure out if the problem is fixable.
